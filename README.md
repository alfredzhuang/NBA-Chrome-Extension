# Technologies used
<p>Frontend: HTML, CSS, DOM, JS</p>
<p>Backend: Chrome API, Fetch API, NBA API</p>

# How it works
<p>Users click on the icon for the chrome extension to open up the chrome extension popup.</p>
<p>Once opened, the chrome extension should show the NBA games on that day and shows the scores for them.</p>
<p>Users can also click on the teams to open up another part of the chrome extension that shows the team's stats.</p>

# Future plans
<p>Currently, the all star game does not render as intended on the chrome extension on the day of the all star game (team images and team statistics do not render).</p>
